# Rearc Data Quest

### Q. What is this quest?
It is a fun way to assess your data skills. It is also a good representative sample of the work we do at Rearc.

### Q. So what skills should I have?
Basic data management concepts. Some programming language. Some AWS.

### Q. What do I have to do?
1) Republish [this open dataset](https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/pr/) in Amazon S3 and share us a link.
2) Script this process so the data can be kept in sync with the source when it updates and send us the script.
3) Don't rely on hard coded names, the script should be able to handle added or removed files.
4) Ensure the script doesn't upload the same file more than once.
5) **BONUS** Query the dataset with Amazon Athena for all the rows from pr.data.0.Current where the value is 2.6. Send us the query results.

### Q. Do I have to do all these?
You can do as many as you like. We suspect though that once you start you won't be able to stop. It's addictive.

### Q. What do I have to submit?
1) Link to data in S3 (if you complete Step 1)
2) Source code (if you complete Step 2 or beyond)
3) Query results (if you complete the Bonus stage)

### Q. What if I successfully complete all the steps?
We have many more for you to solve as a member of the Rearc team!

### Q. What if I fail?
Do. Or do not. There is no fail.

### Q. Can i share this quest with others?
No.
